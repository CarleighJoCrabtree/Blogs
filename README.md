# About

This repository is designed to hold sample code and data used in technical blogs. Whether you want to see the commented code in a quick, accessible way, or download and run the code in your own environment, this tool helps you have SAS code from my blogs on quick demand. 

# Repository Structure

Standalone blogs are in Blogs/BlogTitle structure. 
Each repository contains:

    BlogLink: a file with the link to the associated blog
